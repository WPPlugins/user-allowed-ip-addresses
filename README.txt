Simple plugin that gives the ability to restrict login access to specific IP addresses for specific users.

== Description ==

If you ever needed the ability to have a specific user account only be able to login from specific IP addresses then
this is the plugin for you.  It is a simple plugin that adds an IP Addresses field to the user profile screen.  If you
add in an IP address or a list of IP addresses that user will only be able to login from that IP address.

You have the option to redirect a user to a specific page if their IP address is not in the list of allowed IPs in the
plugin options.  If you don't specify a URL it will redirect back to the homepage.


== Installation ==

You can either browse for this plugin through Wordpress Admin and click install or you can upload the zip file via
Wordpress Admin.

After installing you will see extra field on Edit User page, and you will see setting page under Settings->User Allowed IP Addresses
